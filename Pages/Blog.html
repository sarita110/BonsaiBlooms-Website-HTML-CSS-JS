                            In this 21st century, technology has become a significant part of almost everyone. Since
                            technology is ever on the phase of development, its progress has been nothing but
                            incredible, no matter how vastly it changes. Technology means the skill to convey an idea to
                            reach a goal. But nowadays, the term technology mainly signifies the vast

                        It plays a significant role in modern society, influencing various aspects of our daily lives,
                        such as the way we work, communicate, entertain, and educate ourselves. Technology continues to
                        evolve rapidly, driven by advancements in scientific research and the increasing availability of
                        data and computing power. We now have the ability to transform the environment, extend our
                        lifetime, create big and interconnected societies and even explore various new things about the
                        universe only because of these advanced technologies.</p>

                        The advancement in technology has made our lives easier, more comfortable and enjoyable. It has
                        reduced the effort and time required to complete a task, thus enhancing the quality and
                        efficiency of work. It vastly made it easy to communicate and remain in touch with people from

                            microwaves, electric cookers, television, water heaters, remote control, fridge, or through
                            other larger communication systems such as internet facilities, railways, air routes, and so
                            on. Because of this ever advancing technology and their use in different fields like
                            medical, industrial, banking, education and others, activities are now performed with more
                            ease and effeciently. Thus, technology plays an extremely crucial role in the daily lives of
                            human beings. Due to the pandemic caused by covid-19, the use of technology became more of a
                            necessity for every individual, to maintain their private and professional life. Since
                            people were confined to their home, the use of technology became varied and suddenly every
                            major activites like studying in colleges, working in an office, business in market shifted
                            to online platform making everyones life easier and risk-free. And even after the pandemic,
                            the shift remained which is proving to be an asset to learn more efficiently for students,

                        Even though technology is seen as a boon for easy and comfortable lifestlye, it comes with its
                        own flaws.With technology, the efficiency of a task has increased tenfold and this is often the
                        rationale why thetechnology could be ready to replace humans soon. A rise in technology goes to

                            that humans could do earlier can now be achieved by machines and technology. Thus, creating
                            a shortage of jobs. The evolution of technology in our world today has created a dependence
                            on our devices, tools, and processes. Over-reliance on technology can lead to addiction,
                            particularly with social media and other internet-based platforms. People deal with
                            different mental health problems, like insecurity, loneliness, underachievement about every
                            little things about their life due to the constant comparision to other peoples best moments
                            posted on social media. Excessive use of technology can lead to physical problems as well
                            such as eye strain, neck and back pain, and poor posture. Especially children are at a great
                            risk to become victim of cyber crimes as they are naive and get easily influenced by the
                            unfiltered contents of different social medias. Although technology is already a major part
                            of ones life, it is impossible to always remain upto date due to its vastness, so one must
                            be selective about what to focus on.

                        People for a long time have been running businesses with a physical setup displaying the
                        products and selling them locally through stores. But with the advancement of technology, doing

                            advantage and created a fully automated website called Bonsai Blooms. Because we made the
                            whole process of managing the sells digital, we were able to run the business smoothly from
                            our home and we were able to reach out to customers on globalscale as the products, their
                            details and updates were present for all to see, save, buy or share at any time they wanted.

            <h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Technology is an amazing asset for our daily life which has been developed and adopted because, among
                other things, it improves efficiency, convenience, communication, and access to information. It is
                also
                the driving force behind innovation, economic growth, and global development. Businesses are one of
                the
                most benefited ones from technology due to its global reach with minimal investment. So life is
                almost
                impossible without the help these technologies provide, but one should always be careful about its
                effect on both mental and physical so as to prevent oneself from over-reliance on technology. So, if
                you
                learn how to manage it properly, technology can be a great friend in the twenty-first century.</p>
